# Welcome to Framesurge!

Framesurge is an organization for building the frameworks of the future, founded on the principle that **a general solution is better than a specific one**. In all domains, from academia to web development, solutions that are tailor-made to specific applications, without any thought to a broader general solution, are destined for eventual failure. At some stage in the future, either the application will become obsolete, or the underlying techologies will advance further, or the narrow scope of the solution will become untenable as projects expand.

By pursuing general solutions to the problems of today, especially in the domain of application development, Framesurge aims to develop general solutions that can be used for many applications. This approach creates long-term incentives for continued maintenance on these projects, either by Framesurge or other groups in future, while simultaneously providing the building blocks for tailor-made solutions built on an easily expandable, generic foundation.

Currently, Framesurge is the steward organization of [Perseus](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus), a Rust web development framework, though two more projects will soon join this group, built on the principle of being as widely applicable as possible, and both founded on the powerful state platform that has driven Perseus.
